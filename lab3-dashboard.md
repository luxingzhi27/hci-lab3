## Introduction

I choose the college salaries dataset to complete the data analysis task. Now I’ll introduce the task from the follow two aspects, that is the characteristics of the dataset and our goal of the task.

## characteristics of the dataset

This dataset shows how employment salaries are associated with majors, types of universities, and regions. Of course, it is very meaningful to explore what the change in salary is most related to. It can give you some references to choose your own job. So I decided to show these relationships in three tables.

## goal of the task

The goal of this task is to use three different charts to show the relationship between salary and major types, graduate schools, and geographical regions. Through this task, I can be familiar with the method of displaying data visualization with dash and learn the principles of human-computer interaction’s skill.
